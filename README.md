# LudumDare46
"Mad Sorcerer's Garden"

A game put together for the Ludum Dare 46 Compo. 'Feature' complete with several unimplemented things that I didn't have enough Art to flush out.

I stand on the shoulders of giants. Big thanks to all the Tutorial folks, the helpful answeres on the Godot subreddit and the Godot Q&A.
